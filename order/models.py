# order â†’ each item belongs to a specific order.

# related_name="items" â†’ allows reverse access: order.items.all().

# product â†’ the product being purchased.

# quantity â†’ number of units of that product.

# ðŸ”„ How It All Works Together

# Order = high-level record of a purchase.

# OrderItem = detailed line items (product + quantity).

# ðŸ‘‰ Example:

# User john places an order with:

# 2 Ã— iPhone 14

# 1 Ã— AirPods Pro

# Database:

# Order table:

# id: 12, user: john, total_price: 3500.00, status: Pending


# OrderItem table:

# order: 12, product: iPhone 14, quantity: 2
# order: 12, product: AirPods Pro, quantity: 1

# âœ… Why This Design is Solid

# Scalable: supports multiple products per order.

# Normalized: avoids duplicate data, keeps relationships clean.

# Flexible: OrderItem lets you track per-product quantities.

# Extendable: you can add fields later (e.g., shipping_address, payment_id, discounts, etc.).
