# Used in responses like when COD payment is created or Razorpay order is generated.

# Good for admin/debugging APIs, but for production you might want a "safe" version (to avoid leaking sensitive fields like gateway_signature).

# Serializes the Notification model for API responses.

# Minimal fields: just the message, type (e.g., Payment, Order, System),
# status (read/unread), and timestamp.

# Used by:

# NotificationListAPIView (to list all notifications).

# NotificationMarkReadAPIView (to confirm updates).
# --------------------------------------------------
# ðŸ”¹ How they all work together (Flow)

# Frontend â†’ POST /api/payment/create

# Sends { "order_id": 123, "provider": "razorpay" }

# PaymentCreateSerializer validates:

# Checks if the order belongs to the user.

# Injects the Order object into validated data.

# View creates a Payment record and returns gateway details.

# Frontend completes payment (via Razorpay/Stripe widget)

# Frontend â†’ POST /api/payment/verify

# Sends Razorpay fields (razorpay_order_id, etc.)

# RazorpayVerifySerializer validates structure.

# View uses Razorpay SDK to verify signature and updates order/payment status.

# Notifications

# Any important step (COD chosen, Razorpay order created, Payment confirmed/failed) triggers notify() â†’ creates a Notification.

# NotificationSerializer is used to send them back to frontend.

# âœ… In short:

# PaymentCreateSerializer = ensure order + provider is valid before starting payment.

# RazorpayVerifySerializer = ensure all Razorpay verification fields are present.

# PaymentSerializer = expose payment details to frontend/backend.

# NotificationSerializer = expose user notifications.
